        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          When I was young and would hear about programmers, I always thought 
          that they were so cool! Now that I can code for myself I still think 
          developers are amazing. I love coding and as I Improve my skills, it seems 
          like I enjoy coding even more!
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last 10 years, I've been working warehouse jobs and I've met a
          lot of great people and learned how to work well in teams. This
          experience helps a lot when working with other developers. I actually 
          prefer to work in groups, it makes the job more enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding my interest include reading a good book, playing
          video games, and hitting up the gym. I also like learning about
          different cultures.
